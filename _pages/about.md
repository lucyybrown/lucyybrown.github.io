I am a Statistics PhD student in the School of [Engineering, Mathematics and Physics](https://www.kent.ac.uk/school-of-engineering-mathematics-and-physics) at the University of Kent, UK. I am a member of the research group [Statistical Ecology at Kent](https://research.kent.ac.uk/statistical-ecology/) and the [Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE)](https://www.kent.ac.uk/durrell-institute-conservation-ecology). 

I completed an MMath at the University of Dundee in 2023, achieving a First Class Honours, before moving to the University of Kent for a PhD which is currently on-going. 

My work focuses on population size estimation using official administrative register data, provided through collaborations with [Stockholm University Demography Unit (SUDA)](https://www.su.se/english/research/research-catalogue/research-groups/2/stockholm-university-demography-unit-suda), [Statistics Sweden](https://www.scb.se/en/) and [Statistics Norway](https://www.ssb.no/en). As part of this work, I utilise well-established statistical ecology models with extensions to improve accuracy of population size estimation.
